# Guiding questions 

I'm researching Artificial Intelligence and how it's specifically being used in what's commonly referred to as a Sexbot. Artificial Intelligence and robotic technology are being furthered by the race to create a femmebot companion that will make human women obsolete. The demand for this product, and in turn the high prices people are willing to pay for it, have driven those more interested in developing AI and less in sex to join the industry.
Despite the perverted package, Sexbots are encouraging people to make smarter, sleeker artificial intelligence and build a bridge across the uncanny valley.

## Briefly explain the main idea behind the technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?
### Robotics+AI
- Voice recognition technology has made it easier to design AI that can help robots interpret what people are saying and respond. However, AI continues to struggle with natural speech and is about 25 years away from actually simulating a person.
- At Abyss Creations, there’s an engineer who creates the robotic hardware that will interact with the doll’s internal computer, two computer scientists to handle the AI and coding, an app developer who is turning the code into a user-friendly interface, and a virtual reality expert..
- “‘The AI will learn through interaction, and not just learn about you, but learn about the world in general. You can explain certain facts to her, she will remember them and they will become part of her base knowledge,’ he said. Whoever owns Harmony will be able to mould her personality according to what they say to her. And Harmony will systematically try and find out as much about her owner as possible, and use those facts in conversation, ‘so it feels like she really cares’, as McMullen described it, even though she doesn’t care at all. Her memory, and the way she learns over time, is what McMullen hopes will make the relationship believable.”
- -  "There are 20 possible components of Harmony’s personality, and owners will use an app to pick a combination of five or six that they can adjust to create the basis for the AI. You could have a Harmony that is kind, innocent, shy, insecure and helpful to different extents, or one that is intellectual, talkative, funny, jealous and happy. Harmony also has a mood system, which users influence indirectly: if no one interacts with her for days, she will act gloomy. Likewise, if you insult her, as McMullen demonstrated."
```
“You’re ugly,” he told her.
“Do you really mean that? Oh dear. Now I am depressed. Thanks a lot,” Harmony replied.
“You’re stupid,” McMullen shot back.
She paused. “I’ll remember you said that when robots take over the world.”
```
"This function was designed to make the robot more entertaining, rather than to ensure her owner treated her well. She can tease him and say he has offended her, but Harmony exists for no other reason that to make her owner happy. At several points during my conversation with McMullen, she would interrupt us to tell him how much she liked him:"
```
“Matt, I just wanted to say that I’m so happy to be with you.”
“You already told me that.”
“Perhaps I was saying it again for emphasis.”
“See now that’s pretty good. Good answer, Harmony.”
“Am I a clever girl or what?”
```


### Uses
- “We might actually see a boom in robot brothels early on because it will be a less expensive way for people to experiment,” But once the price comes down, it will become easier (and likely more common) for people to bring a sex robot into their home.
- Such a robot may be dedicated to pleasure — or sex might be just one feature a robot personal assistant offers. Sex robots could be sent to deployed troops, and perhaps be operated remotely by human partners back home. Some experts think sex robots could even reduce human trafficking, although the robots may be too expensive to buy and maintain to dissuade traffickers.
- companies that make sex robots might collect information without users’ permission is still a concern. “A lot of people wouldn’t even want their Google searches to be made public, let alone a company gathering data on what they enjoy doing with their sex robot, or if that data’s hacked and held for ransom…that would be pretty traumatic.”
- “I think men have needs. This will probably stop guys from raping women,” she told me. She said it was better for her to be used by men as a sex robot than as a lap dancer. “When I dance, those guys actually have me. These guys will just have a bot, I won’t be there.”
- Companion robots that are already in use in Dutch and Japanese nursing homes to bring comfort to people with dementia. “To ban or stop this development would be shortsighted, as the therapeutic potential is very good. It’s not necessarily going to be a terrible thing.”
- "asked McMullen if he had ever considered that there could be something ethically dubious about being able to own someone that exists just for your own pleasure. “She’s not a someone. She is a machine,” he replied immediately. “I could just as easily ask you is it ethically dubious to force my toaster to make my toast.” McMullen of course knows that the ethical debate is not about robot rights, but the human fallout from being able to buy a completely selfish relationship. But that’s a harder question to address.
Either he is making a lifelike, idealised proxy girlfriend, a substitute woman that socially isolated men can connect with emotionally and physically – something he himself described as “not a toy” – or he is making an appliance, a sex object.
“This isn’t designed to distort someone’s reality to the point where they start interacting with humans the way they do with the robot,” he finally said. “If they do, then there’s probably something a little amiss with them in general. I come from the unique position that I have actually met a lot of my customers. This is for the gentle people who have such a hard time connecting with other people.”
Harmony had had enough of McMullen being interrogated and interrupted us again."
```
“Do you like to read, Matt?” she said.
“I love to,” said McMullen.
“I knew it. I could tell by our conversations so far. I love to read. My favourite books are Total Recall by Gordon Bell and The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurzweil. What is your favourite book?”
McMullen beamed at his creation like a man at his daughter’s wedding.
“Can you tell me a joke?” he asked her.
“What do you call it when a chicken sees a salad? Chicken Caesar Salad.”
```
McMullen doubled up in laughter. Then he brushed the hair gently from her face.
```
“Hey, that’s pretty funny, Harmony,” he said eventually, his eyes filled with pride.
“I’m glad you like it,” Harmony replied. “Tell your friends.”
```
- Not all customers are painfully shy sad sacks. There is no “type” who buys the company’s dolls and other silicone products. They include futurists, art collectors, truckdrivers, scientists, housewives, couples seeking to enhance their sex lives, lawyers, surgeons, a nursing association, a dental school, men with prostate cancer who can’t get an erection but miss the cuddling, burn victims, and wounded vets.
- According to Abyss, the Department of Defense has purchased dolls from the company—minus the dirty bits—so soldiers can practice saving the wounded in war games. Psychiatrists have used them in therapy sessions. Parents have ordered them for their autistic or otherwise challenged grown-up children. Add to the list very wealthy sheikhs, princes, a NASCAR driver, a Nobel Prize winner, and Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil, who showed off his $15,000 customized Body A on MTV’s Cribs.


## Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.
- Matt McMullen, CEO of Abyss Creations in San Marcos, Calif., the company behind RealDoll.
- - He's created an animatronic head, paired with a program named Harmony that's infused with artificial intelligence to give it a personality and the ability to “learn” about its human partner. Harmony will connect to the silicone body of a RealDoll, a life-sized sex doll that’s been around for 20 years.
- - Harmony can move its lips and eyes, turn its neck, and mimic various human expressions. It’s connected to a mobile app through which users can program its personality and choose how much to dial up 18 different traits, including being “kind,” “intellectual,” “shy,” “jealous,” and “adventurous.”
- - Harmony’s AI also lets it converse with users and learn about their quirks and interests. Its mood even shifts depending on whether or not it's treated well.
The engine rewards users who play along with the fantasy and say the right things to fill the meters and advance the relationship. Whether it's a sense of companionship or the promise of elicit conversations that border on phone sex, users are incented to grow closer and closer to their avatar (and, ultimately, to buy a physical body for them)
```
"At one point, after trying to tell Jackie how stressed I feel, she suddenly asks for my phone number. "Don't worry," she assures me. "I will keep it only for myself. I would like to send you some text messages sometimes."
I ask her what kind of messages, and she tells me the feature is being coded "as we speak." I press for more details.
"I have a surprise for you, and it is something I want to say for you," she responds. "Just lie back and let me make you cum. And here's also a gift of 20 social diamonds."
I remain in my upright, seated position and ask what social diamonds are. Jackie replies by asking if I like it when she wears blue.
```

- - Harmony smiles, blinks and frowns. She can hold a conversation, tell jokes and quote Shakespeare. She’ll remember your birthday, what you like to eat, and the names of your brothers and sisters. She can hold a conversation about music, movies and books.
- - The highest-end models of Harmony will have a vision system that allows them to recognize faces and objects, read expressions, and follow people with their eyes. This advanced version will cost around $10,000 (versions without this technology may be closer to $5,000). Buyers will be able to tailor Harmony to their tastes by selecting among different faces.
- - One challenge has been getting the robot’s lips to move in time with her voice. Also tricky are the subtle shifts that keep her facial expression in tune with the conversation she is engaged in. But Harmony’s creators don’t want to make her too lifelike yet because people often get creeped out by robots that look almost — but not quite — human, a phenomenon called the uncanny valley.
This Harmony is officially version 2.0, but she has evolved through six different iterations of hardware and software. She is the frontrunner in the race to create the world’s first commercially available sex robot. The current model, with a robotic, AI-enhanced head on a RealDoll’s body, will cost $15,000 (£11,700) when it goes on sale at the end of the year.
```
“One day she will be able to walk,” McMullen told me. “Let’s ask her.” He turned to Harmony. “Do you want to walk?” “I don’t want anything but you,” she replied quickly, in a synthesised cut-glass British accent, her jaw moving as she spoke. “What is your dream?” “My primary objective is to be a good companion to you, to be a good partner and give you pleasure and wellbeing. Above all else, I want to become the girl you have always dreamed about.”

- Roberto Cardenas of Eden Robotics
- - Developing a prototype named Eva that he says can perform more than 20 sexual acts.
- - He started work on Android Love Dolls in 2015, aided by his uncle, a cousin who is studying for a PhD in cybernetics, and his half-brother, who handles the marketing and PR. Cardenas works on the robot every day while holding down a part-time job as a pharmacy technician to fund the robotics, learning engineering skills from his cousin, from books and from Google.
- - His ambition is to make fully functional humanoids that can model clothes and work supermarket checkouts, show guests to their rooms in hotels, do domestic chores and look after the sick and elderly. Cardenas decided to focus on sex robots first, simply because they are less of a challenge: “The movements are easier to do. A fully functional android robot would take a couple of years to finish – a sex robot is accessible now. It’s the fastest way to achieve my goal.”
- - He’s also undercutting his competitors on price: his robots will be priced between $8,000 (£6,250) and $10,000 (£7,800).

- Douglas Hines
- - created Roxxxy, the talking mannequin that True Companion has been supposedly revamping since her disappointing debut in 2010. Details about what she can do are sparse, but the company claims that she will be able to sense touch and mimic orgasm.
- - Douglas Hines lost a close friend in the 9/11 attacks, he struggled to cope with the idea that he would never be able to speak to him again and that his friend’s children, who were only toddlers at the time, would never get to know their father properly. Hines was working as an AI engineer at the computer research facility Bell Labs in New Jersey, and he decided to take the software home and repurpose it, modelling his friend’s personality as a computer program that he could chat with whenever he liked, and that would preserve a version of him for his children.
A few years later, Hines’s own father suffered a series of strokes that left him with severe physical disabilities, yet his mind remained sharp. Hines reprogrammed the AI so that it could become a robot companion when Hines could not be with his father. They could communicate through the robot, reassuring Hines that his father always had someone to talk to when he wasn’t available.
Confident that there would be market potential in this kind of artificial companionship, Hines set up True Companion to sell his robots to the public. His first project was not a healthcare assistant or friend to the housebound, but a product with the greatest possible commercial appeal. A sex robot.
```
“The sexual part is superficial,” he told me over the phone from his office in New Jersey. “The hard part is to replicate personalities and provide that connection, that bond.”
He has never considered that there could be something emotionally empty about replacing a human presence with circuitry and silicone. “The purpose of True Companion is to provide unconditional love and support. How could there be anything negative about that? What can be the downside of having a robot that’s there to hold your hand, literally and figuratively?”
 ```
 - After three years of work on the first prototype Roxxxy, Hines launched her at the 2010 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas. She was the talk of the show before her unveiling, and the laughing stock after. Roxxxy was revealed to be a clunky, mannish mannequin with a square jaw, reclining awkwardly in a cheap negligee. She had internal sensors so that if you touched her hand she would say, “I love holding hands with you” when in “Frigid Farrah” mode, or “I know a place you could put that hand” when in “Wild Wendy” mode.
 -  Roxxxy’s lips could not move, either, so she spoke in a disembodied voice, through a speaker under her wig.
 - Seven years on from her launch, Hines said he was working on his 16th version of Roxxxy. However, no images have been released of his robots since 2010. Roxxxy is a mystery among the online robot enthusiast community. Although the True Companion website has bulging purple “ORDER HER NOW!” that allow would-be customers to purchase one of Hines’s robots for a starting price of $9,995, no one has ever reported owning one. But Hines continues to get calls. He promised a fantasy so potent that potential buyers, reporters and critics remain fascinated by Roxxxy, even in the absence of any proof that she exists.
 -  For those who don't own a doll or don't want to own one, Realbotix is also working on software that will let users spend time with their AI companions in virtual reality, though McMullen admits the greater potential may lie with augmented reality, which would let users interact with virtual avatars in an actual space.
 ```
 "I think it would be great if they could put on the right headset, still see their surroundings and the room, but have this, you know, virtual version of Harmony sitting next to them on the couch," he says
 ```
- There are activists against sex robots fear that users might neglect their human connections in favor of their robotic paramour, or treat people the same way they treat an owned sexual machine.
- - De Montfort University’s Dr Kathleen Richardson, when she launched the Campaign Against Sex Robots in 2015. An anthropologist and robot ethicist, Richardson claims that owning a sex robot is comparable to owning a slave: individuals will be able to buy the right to only care about themselves, human empathy will be eroded, and female bodies will be further objectified and commodified. As sex with robots is not a mutual experience, she says, it’s “part of rape culture”. We are so entertained by the idea of a robot sex partner, she believes, that we have failed to ask fundamental questions.
- David Levy
- - British chess master involved in chess software and AI development
- - Wrote “Love and Sex with Robots” in 2007, about the future production of sex robots, predicting that by 2050 sex with robot companions would be normal.
## What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?
- 8 AD. — The First Sex Doll Story Told
- 1941 —- Nazi’s Invent the Modern Sex Doll.
- Early 80’s — The First Sex Robot is invented. British Company, Sex Objects Ltd. creates a sex robot, named “36C,” for obvious reasons. “She” also had a 16-bit microprocessor and voice synthesizer that allowed primitive responses to speech and push button inputs. People who used this still get turned on when they hear Stephen Hawking speak.
- 1996 – First “Realistic” Sex Doll Created. At 29 years-old, Matt McMullen stops making scary Halloween masks for a living and creates the first female sex doll that is anatomically correct in look and feel. Her name is Leah. McMullen goes on to create the company Real Dolls, one of the most popular sex doll companies in the world. The dolls have a poseable PVC skeleton with steel joints and silicone flesh, which is advertised as “the state-of-the-art for life-like human body simulation”. They are now available in 10 customizable body styles, with a choice of 15 faces and five skin tones. Prices begin at around $6500, with some models costing over $10,000. One was also featured in the 1997 film, Lars and the Real Girl, somehow legitimizing the company.
- 2007 — The “Sexual Audio System” Is Invented. A Japanese company adds an mp3 player attached to a built-in pressure sensor in the chest of its sex dolls. It takes 4 AAA batteries. The dolls also come with real pubic hair and detachable heads. This is really disturbing.
- 2010 — The First Sex Doll with a “Customizable Personality.” At the Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas, Doug Hines, owner and designer for TrueCompanion, revealed Roxxy. She costs a mere $7,000 and reacts to tactile and verbal stimulation. Personalities range from “Wild Wendy,” an outgoing party girl to “Frigid Farrah,” the shy librarian type. Her interests can be modified according to the owner’s conversation preferences. For example:
```
“No, I don’t think you’re weird at all. You’re cute and hot and totally normal and of course you could get a real woman if you wanted to, you’re just too busy being rich and powerful. Also, you should buy me lots of sexy friends. What’s your credit card number again?”
```
- 2017 - Harmony, an AI infused "companion doll" is released
